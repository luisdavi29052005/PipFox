The ones we do have are bit grainy and back then I guess everyone just sort of posed kind of stoically in photos. This one though, they are both smiling in what seems to be a very candid moment. It makes me smile to seem them this way. I would be forever grateful if this could enhanced and the blurriness removed. Thank you in advance for your time and talents.",
